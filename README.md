# Training: Setup React development environment

## What is this?

A repository to practice how to set up manually a React development environment without any starter kit.

## What does it have?

This repository contains:
1. A basic _Git_ + _Webpack_ + _React_ development environment setup.
2. A script to remove all setups and leave the repo empty.

## How to use it?

1. Clone the repository.
2. Reset working directory running `yarn reset` (or `npm run reset`). This will remove all files in the directory so that you can start setting up the development environment yourself.
3. Run `yarn start` (or `npm run start`) to check if your settings work.
